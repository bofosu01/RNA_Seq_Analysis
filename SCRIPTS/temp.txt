shrinkage estimation
7 NA values were found during variance shrinkage estimation due to mean observation values outside of the range used for the LOESS fit.
The LOESS fit will be repeated using exact computation of the fitted surface to extrapolate the missing values.
These are the target ids with NA values: YP_081574.1, YP_081606.1, YP_081539.1, YP_081583.1, YP_081584.1, YP_081496.1, YP_081563.1
